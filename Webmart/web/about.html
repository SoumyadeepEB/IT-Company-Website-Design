                            <li>Creative graphic artist visualizes and then proceeds to design the layout (5-10 hours)</li>
                            <li>The template is then sent to our Quality Control team to inspect, if it fails to spark our interest, it is sent back for re-work. 
                                If it passes quality control, then it sent to next phase.
                            </li>
                            <li>Website designer cuts the Photoshop graphic file into HTML compatible pages (2-3 hours)</li>
                            <li>The template is again sent to our Quality Control team who analyzes the HTML design quality, if it passes then it is available for download, otherwise it is sent back for adjustments</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        The average template takes about 7-15 hours to produce.

                    <p>
                        Web design templates are growing in popularity as it is now much more affordable and quicker to use than hiring a web development team to design a website for you. 
                        The cost of hiring a web development team can cost 1000x more than a simple template membership pass. 
                        By purchasing pre-made website templates you avoid having to hire web designers and graphic artists to create your website.
                        <br>
                        With webmart, you finally have the chance to have the impressive website design you've always dreamed about!
